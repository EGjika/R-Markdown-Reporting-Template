# Introduction to R Markdown for Reporting


R Markdown is a powerful tool that allows you to integrate R code with narrative text, creating dynamic and reproducible documents. With R Markdown, you can seamlessly combine code, results, and text in a single document, making it ideal for generating reports, presentations, articles, and more.

## Getting Started with R Markdown:

1.  **Installation**: Ensure that you have R and RStudio installed on your computer. RStudio provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, making it easier to work with R Markdown documents.

2.  **Creating an R Markdown Document**: In RStudio, go to `File` -\> `New File` -\> `R Markdown`. You will be prompted to choose a document format; for PDF reports, select `PDF`.

3.  **Document Setup**: Once you've selected the document format, you can specify the title, author, and other metadata for your document.

4.  **Writing Content**: R Markdown documents use a simple and intuitive syntax for formatting text. You can write narrative text using Markdown syntax, which supports headings, lists, links, and more. Code chunks can be embedded within the document using triple backticks (\`\`\`), allowing you to execute R code directly within the document.

5.  **Code Execution**: Code chunks in R Markdown documents are executed sequentially, and the results are displayed inline within the document. You can specify options such as code chunk labels, chunk evaluation options, and chunk output options.

6.  **Knitting**: Once you've written your R Markdown document, you can knit it into the desired output format (e.g., PDF) by clicking the `Knit` button in RStudio. This process executes the R code chunks, generates the output, and renders the final document.

## Generating PDF Reports:

1.  **Customizing Output**: R Markdown allows you to customize the appearance of your PDF report by specifying document options, including page layout, font size, and margins.

2.  **Graphics**: You can include plots and graphics generated from R code directly within your PDF report. R Markdown supports various plotting libraries, including base R graphics, ggplot2, and lattice.

3.  **Tables**: Tabular data can be displayed as tables in your PDF report. R Markdown provides flexible options for creating and formatting tables, including data frames, knitr tables, and kableExtra.

4.  **Exporting**: Once your R Markdown document is knitted into a PDF report, you can export it as a standalone PDF file for distribution or sharing with others.

# Tables

## Dealing with tables

Iris is a very known dataset used for many purpose in R. In this template we will use that dataset for data analysis and visualizations. Do you know how easy is to show an image in your report? Just take care of saving it and then call it as in the code.

The following table describes the distribution of our data.We are using **kable** for tables.

![Iris Flower](iris_flower.jpg)

```{r include=FALSE}
data(iris)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

Table<-table(iris$Species)
# Print the table using kable
kable(Table, format = "markdown", caption = "Species distribution")
```

\newpage

# Individual characteristics

## Number and Description

In this section we will see how to incorporate calculations within text. In R Markdown, you can seamlessly incorporate inline calculations within your text by enclosing the expression within backticks which will render as a text when knitted.

```{r include=FALSE}

## Load Iris dataset
#data(iris)


# Count the number of candidates that we will report
data_species <- iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa") %>% nrow()
data_petal_length <- iris %>% filter(Petal.Length >= 1.6) %>% nrow()
data_sepal_width <- iris %>% filter(Sepal.Width >= 4.9) %>% nrow()

```

Reporting counts in text:

-   **`r paste(data_species)`** Number of individuals for 'setosa' species

-   **`r paste(data_petal_length)`** Number of individuals with Petal.Length \>= 1.6

-   **`r paste(data_sepal_width)`** Number of individuals with Sepal.Width \>= 4.9

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Summary statistics for each numeric variable
summary_stats <- iris %>%
  summarise(
    Sepal_Length_mean = mean(Sepal.Length),
    Sepal_Length_median = median(Sepal.Length),
    Sepal_Length_sd = sd(Sepal.Length),
    Sepal_Length_min = min(Sepal.Length),
    Sepal_Length_max = max(Sepal.Length),
    Sepal_Width_mean = mean(Sepal.Width),
    Sepal_Width_median = median(Sepal.Width),
    Sepal_Width_sd = sd(Sepal.Width),
    Sepal_Width_min = min(Sepal.Width),
    Sepal_Width_max = max(Sepal.Width),
    Petal_Length_mean = mean(Petal.Length),
    Petal_Length_median = median(Petal.Length),
    Petal_Length_sd = sd(Petal.Length),
    Petal_Length_min = min(Petal.Length),
    Petal_Length_max = max(Petal.Length),
    Petal_Width_mean = mean(Petal.Width),
    Petal_Width_median = median(Petal.Width),
    Petal_Width_sd = sd(Petal.Width),
    Petal_Width_min = min(Petal.Width),
    Petal_Width_max = max(Petal.Width)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value") %>%
  separate(Variable, c("Variable", "Statistic"), sep = "_", extra = "merge")

# Print summary statistics as a formatted table using kable
Table_2.1<-knitr::kable(summary_stats, format = "markdown",caption = "Descriptive statistics")

Table_2.1
# # add a footnote
# Table_2.1 %>% 
#   add_footnote("Please note this statistics are based on the observed counts.")
# 
# # if more footnote : add_footnote(x, c("footnote 1", "footnote 2"), notation = "symbol")

```

\newpage

# Visualizations

## Histogram and Barchart

Below are the histograms for numerical variables and barchart for categorical variable showing the frequencies for each variable. For Figure numbering and title we make sure we write in the chunk options for example: fig.cap="Iris data visualizations".

```{r fig.cap="Iris data visualizations",echo=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=14, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Histograms for numerical variables
histograms <- iris %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Species, names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Value, fill = Species)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, position = "identity", alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~Variable, nrow = 1, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Histograms for Numerical Variables", x = "Value", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

# Bar chart for species
bar_chart <- iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Species, fill = Species)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Species Distribution", x = "Species", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

# Combine plots
combined_plots <- cowplot::plot_grid(histograms, bar_chart, nrow = 2)

# Print combined plots
print(combined_plots)
```

\newpage

# Correlations

This code will create a grid of scatterplots for each pair of numeric variables in the Iris dataset along with histograms for each variable's distribution on the diagonal, and correlation coefficients in the upper and lower triangles of the grid. This provides a comprehensive visualization of the relationships and correlations between the numeric variables.

```{r fig.cap="Correlation plot using GGally library",echo=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(GGally)
library(dplyr)
# Create correlation plot using GGally
correlation_plot <- ggpairs(iris, columns = 1:4, ggplot2::aes(colour = Species))

# Print correlation plot
print(correlation_plot)


```

\newpage

# Conclusions

Based on the correlation plot generated using the GGally package with the iris dataset, we can draw several conclusions:

1.  **Positive Correlation between Variables**:
    -   In the scatterplot matrix, we observe positive correlations between some pairs of variables. This is indicated by the upward trend in the scatterplots, where an increase in one variable tends to be associated with an increase in the other variable.
2.  **Negative Correlation between Variables**:
    -   Conversely, we also notice negative correlations between certain pairs of variables, depicted by a downward trend in the scatterplots. In these cases, an increase in one variable is typically associated with a decrease in the other variable.
3.  **Strength of Correlation**:
    -   The strength of correlation varies across different pairs of variables. Some pairs exhibit strong correlations, where points cluster tightly around the trend line, indicating a strong linear relationship. In contrast, other pairs show weaker correlations, with points scattered more widely around the trend line.
4.  **Outliers and Data Distribution**:
    -   We identify outliers in the data, which are points that deviate significantly from the general trend observed in the scatterplots. These outliers could potentially represent anomalous data points or errors in measurement.
    -   The histograms on the diagonal of the scatterplot matrix provide insights into the distribution of each individual variable. We observe the shape, spread, and skewness of the distributions, which can help in understanding the data's characteristics.
5.  **Species Differentiation**:
    -   By coloring the data points based on the species variable, we can discern patterns specific to each species. This facilitates the identification of any species-specific trends or clusters in the data.
6.  **Further Analysis**:
    -   While the correlation plot provides valuable insights into the relationships between variables, further analysis may be warranted to explore causality or to build predictive models based on these relationships. Techniques such as regression analysis or machine learning algorithms can be employed for deeper exploration and modeling.
